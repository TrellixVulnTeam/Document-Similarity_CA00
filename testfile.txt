It is hard from the standpoint of the child, who must spend many years acquiring a language.
it is hard for the adult language learner, it is hard for the scientist who attempts to model the relevant phenomena,
 and it is hard for the engineer who attempts to build systems that deal with natural language input or output. 
 These tasks are so hard that Turing could rightly make fluent conversation in natural language the centerpiece of 
 his test for intelligence.
